# SC4_KMS_CNC_MOD
This repository holds the files I used to convert a 2021 Paulimot SC4 manual Lathe to CNC.
All Files are provided as is. To warranty or support will be available from my side. Do everything on your own risk with a good portion of common sense.

The Files are split into two parts. 
The folder Z-Axis contains everything related to the Z Axis, the X-Axis folder obviously the parts for the X-Axis.
You could just modify one axis and keep the other one manually if you like. 

For details on this build have a look at my video Series on YouTube:
